# iWatchIconCreator
An iWatch Icon Quick Creation Script

Run the script then copy and paste the icons into the <your application> WatchKit App/Images.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/ folder.

The images will then auto-appear in the Images.xcassets folder view in XCode.  Just drag and drop the images around and your warnings will go away.

Happy Coding!
